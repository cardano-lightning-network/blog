## Vision

The Cardano Lightning initiative wants to bring the power of [lightning](https://lightning.network/) to Cardano.

## Story

The initial team met at the excellent [Cardano Buidler Fest #1](https://buidl.2024.cardano.org/).
They had a shared prior interest in tailoring L2s to meet specific use cases
with [subbit.xyz](https://subbit.xyz) and [Marlowe](https://marlowe.iohk.io/) signed inputs.

Over beers and burger, Cardano Lightning was born.
