## Intro

This is an introductory part of our guide to Cardano Lightning Network (or Cardano Lightning - `CL` in short) series. 
You can find list of all the episodes down below.

In this series we want to skip some technical details and present only the core concepts from Bitcoin Lightning Network (`BLN`) and 
how they possibly can be translated to `CLN`. 
We want to present them in an easy to digest form - if anything is unclear please let us know through 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/CardanoLightnin) or our [GitHub](https://github.com/cardano-lightning-nework/blog) repo. 
Our goals is to be as transparent and well understood as we can be. 
At the same time we want to show how simple, *portable* and lightweight this solution can be on Cardano.

## Goals of The `CLN` Project

Different flavors of `L2` solutions have different goals and architectures. 
The main objective of this project is to provide a scalable payment solution for Cardano which can grow organically. 
To achieve this goal we want to steal as many good ideas from `BLN` or other systems which solve similar problem and **efficiently** port them to our blockchain.

The simpler the solution the better. 
Simplicity possibly increases portability to different environments (web, mobile, embeded etc.), simplifies reasoning (composition, indexers etc.) and of course the implementation. 
All these mean faster delivery and adoption.
