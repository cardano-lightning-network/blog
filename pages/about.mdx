## Who are we?

We are at them moment pretty small team of Cardano devs who formed this project driven by our own interest in this area. We were doing some experiments on our own (subbit.xyz, Marlowe signed inputs) and when we met on the Cardano Buidler Fest we decided that we can actually make a significant positive impact pretty quickly.
